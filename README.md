We have 3 datasets:
• Twitter-archive-enhanced: a csv file downloaded manually and wrangled as a dataframe named "df_1".
• Image_predictions: a tsv gathered programmatically using the ‘requests’ library from this url :

and wrangled as a dataframe named "df_2".
• Tweet_json : a txt file gathered from tweets JSON data using the twitter API ‘tweepy’, then read line by line to be wrangled as a dataframe named "df_3".
